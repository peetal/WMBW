## About the repo

This is the code base for the manuscript titled "The Role of Neural Load Effects in Predicting Individual Differences in Working Memory Function": https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.118656. 

In this manuscript, we demonstrated that the neural load effect size could be harnessed to guide feature selection process in order to build predictive models for human working memory function. The resulted model (i.e., models with only the most useful features as indicated by the heuristic) showed greater predictive accuracies compared to models that unselectively included all features.
